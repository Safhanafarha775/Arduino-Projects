# ðŸ¤– Obstacle Avoiding System using Ultrasonic Sensor and Buzzer

This project detects obstacles using an **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** and alerts the user with a **Buzzer** when an object comes within a certain distance.  
Itâ€™s a basic version of obstacle avoidance used in **robotics, parking systems, and smart sticks for the blind**.
