# Ultrasonic Object Detection with Buzzer

This Arduino project detects nearby objects using an **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** and triggers a **buzzer** when the distance is below a set threshold.

## 🧠 Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Buzzer  
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor measures distance by sending and receiving sound waves.  
If an object is detected within 10 cm, the buzzer turns ON.
