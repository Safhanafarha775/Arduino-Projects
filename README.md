# 💡 Arduino-Projects
A collection of my beginner to advanced Arduino projects built and simulated using Arduino IDE and TinkerCad.
  

Each project focuses on learning sensors, actuators, and coding logic used in **Robotics, IoT, and Embedded Systems**.

---

## 🧩 Projects Included

1. [🚦 Traffic Light System](01_Traffic_Light_System/README.md)  
   → A simple LED-based traffic signal simulation that cycles through red, yellow, and green lights.

2. [📏 Obstacle Avoiding System](02_Obstacle_Avoiding_System/README.md)  
   → Uses an **Ultrasonic Sensor** to detect obstacles and triggers a **buzzer alert** when an object comes too close.

## 🛠️ Tools & Platforms Used
- **Arduino IDE** (C/C++ based programming)
- **Tinkercad Circuits** (for online simulation)
- **GitHub** (for documentation & portfolio)

---

## 🌱 My Goal
To learn and master **Arduino programming** and **Robotics fundamentals** step-by-step while creating real-world mini projects that improve my coding, logic, and design skills.
